# 4.  Write a program to implement a priority queue (using Max_Heap).
#  The program should contain the following functions:
# a.    Maximum(S)
# b.    Extract_Max(S)
# c.    Increase_key(S, i, key)
# d.    Insert (A, key)

# Show that each of the above methods takes logn time for running, where n is the problem size.
